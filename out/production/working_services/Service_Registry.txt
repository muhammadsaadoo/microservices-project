Service Registry
we hard code the url of service it is not a good practice
so we use service registry to store the information or location of all the services
and when we need any service we will use service registry to discover any service

     auth          |
     Manufacturer  -----register------>  service Registry
     Product       |

when the service run it registers and unregister it when it shuts down
so we use spring cloud eureka for service registry
cretate a new project from spring init
add cpring eurika dependency add it in
add it in ouw wroking repository
add annotaion to he main classs   @EnableEurikaServer

application.properties
  spring.application.name=service-registry
  server.port=8761
  eureka.client.register-with-eureka =false
  eureka.client.fetch-registry=false

now open service to be register like product manufacturer and auth etc
  add dependency
  eurika discovery client
  also eurica cloud/dependency management
  also add cloud  version in properties in pom.xml

on localhost it will run and we can see it on browsewr
now add properties in yml in microservice that to be registerd like manufacturer
  eureka.client.register-with-eureka=true
  eureka.client.fetch-registry=true
  and service url

then run it and  it will register itself on eureka server
that we can seee on localhost of eureka interface on browser

now add all the services on eurika same as we add manufacturer
............................................................................
now communicayion between services after register them in service registry
 we can not access the service with its name
 so we use GATEWAY it will do all the routing

http://localhost:8761/

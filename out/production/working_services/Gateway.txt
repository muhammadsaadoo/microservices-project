Gateway
it will provide all the routing to communicate the service using service registry
we can access the service using service name
so for example if we change the api name(we use in rest template) to product-service it will not work
because the RestTemplate is not load balanced
so how we can do this

we need to create a Class AppConfig
we create a method that returns RestTemplate pbject
add @Bean
and @LoadBalanced

and we change the localhost to Product-Service in api call
now it will work

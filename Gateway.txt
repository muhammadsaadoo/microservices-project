Gateway
it will provide all the routing to communicate the service using service registry
we can access the service using service name
so for example if we change the api name(we use in rest template) to product-service it will not work
because the RestTemplate is not load balanced
so how we can do this

we need to create a Class AppConfig
we create a method that returns RestTemplate pbject
add @Bean
and @LoadBalanced

and we change the localhost to Product-Service in api call
now it will work

http vs LB(load balanced)
 lb means gate way would use spring cloud service discovery machanism to locate an instance of service
when use lb the discovery(eurika server is used to locate or discover the servive)
so you need to mention onlu service name

lb is good when you run multiple instances of a service
forexample you have 10 instancses of product mivsoservice
so the requests are distributed evenly to all th einstances(if 10 request and 5 instances -->each has 2 req)
so lb is good in such conditons
practice-->
  create a new instance of product service
  goto edit configuratio
  select the service
  click copy icon right to th + -
  name it
  pass program arguments so we change the port
  click modify options
  add vm options
  add arguments -Dserver.port=9082
  apply
  run it it will add in servies in mavin

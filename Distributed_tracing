Distributed Tracing
it is used to trace api request(http request) in Distributed system from start to end without logging
for example
           we have a request that will traverse over 40 to 50 microservices
           so how we can track this
           we need to log each service to track it but its overhead
           so we use distributed tracing to trace a request in microservices
           we can trace duration,  error analysis and debugging of request in each service
           also track the Dependencies
           performance optimization

what tool should we use?
ZIPKIN
its distributed tracing system

microservice-->|collector--->Storage--search---visualization|

client send request-->M1------>M2--------->M3
span id              sid       sid         sid         for each service
Trace id----------------------Trace Id----->>>>>>      for whole request

span used to trace time matadata work done etc on each service
but trace tells the whole request trace

                  trace
               span    span
trace is parents and span is child

Implementation

1st way
download zipkin jar file from zipkin.com (read docs)
run it from cmd
and access it from localhost

2nd way
BUT
we can use it from docker
run command to pull the image (command from zipkin quick start tab)
run on localhost
then configure docker compose to manage it

Micrometer
it is a middleman between application and metrics collection system(gives us app info)
it gives us interface for measure different aspects of application like
resource utilization time constraints response time etc

implement ZIPKIN in our app
add dependency zipkin
we need 2 dependencies
if you are using open feign we need to add one more dependency
fain micrometer
also actuator dependency

                </dependency>

configure zipkin
management.tracing.sampling.probability=1.0   //we are telling to trace  each and every request

1.0 means every request will be traced
0.5 means 50% requests will be traced
